Exploration of 4 exploratory questions to be answered via association rule mining

# Problem Questions
**1. Exploring behavioural patterns of excelling students**
 
In this context, the aim is to analyse the study habits, attendance habits, and external activities of students. Behavioural aspects can then be discerned whether they contribute significantly towards overall academic performances. Patterns that indicate success among students will shed light on effective strategies to optimise student performance.

**2. Does home-environment influence academic performance?**

This question considers whether the background of a student has any influence on the academic performance outcome. It dives deeper into investigating whether a parents’ status, such as their occupation and marital status, makes a difference or if it is purely up to an individual to determine the fate of their academic outcome. The question also explores whether the educational background  of parents is  a deterrent towards better academic performance. From here, we are able to gain a nuanced understanding of  how home-related attributes shape academic success.

**3. What personal attributes affect a student's academic performance?**

This question probes into a students’ current academic situation such as their current location, their salary if they possess a job, and their high school educational background. Other personal attributes such as their age and gender will also be taken into consideration to investigate how pivotal their role is towards a students’ academic performance. The  outcome of this is to possibly formulate ways to subside the negative effects and enhance the positive influence of those attributes.
